**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized machine learning paradigm where a server collaborates with a group of clients to learn a global model without accessing the clients' data. User heterogeneity is a significant challenge for FL, which together with the class-distribution imbalance further enhances the difficulty of FL. Great progress has been made in large vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), which paves a new way for image classification and object recognition. Inspired by the success of CLIP on few-shot and zero-shot learning, we use CLIP to optimize the federated learning between server and client models under its vision-language supervision. It is promising to mitigate the user heterogeneity and class-distribution balance due to the powerful cross-modality representation and rich open-vocabulary prior knowledge of CLIP. In this paper, we propose the CLIP-guided FL (CLIP2FL) method on heterogeneous and long-tailed data. In CLIP2FL, the knowledge of the off-the-shelf CLIP model is transferred to the client-server models, and a bridge is built between the client and server. Specifically, for client-side learning, knowledge distillation is conducted between client models and CLIP to improve the ability of client-side feature representation. For server-side learning, in order to mitigate the heterogeneity and class-distribution imbalance, we generate federated features to retrain the server model. A prototype contrastive learning with the supervision of the text encoder of CLIP is introduced to generate federated features depending on the client-side gradients, and they are used to retrain a balanced server classifier. Extensive experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves impressive performance and effectively deals with data heterogeneity.
